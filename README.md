# How to use

Enter the /ftblang <lang> command in the chat bar, such as /ftblang en_us;

Wait for the export path prompt to pop up on the screen, which means the export is successful;

Find and open the FTBLang folder according to the export path prompt, and overwrite the config/ftbquests in the game root directory;

If KubeJS is installed, copy the files in the kubeJS directory to the kubeJS directory in the game root directory;

If KubeJS is not installed, you can also choose to use resourcepack, and put the resource pack in the FTBLang directory into the resource pack folder in the game root directory.

The backup folder contains the original ftbquests file;

The config folder contains the exported ftbquests file;

The kubejs folder contains the kubejs-related language files;

FTB-Quests-Localization-Resourcepack is the language resource pack file.
